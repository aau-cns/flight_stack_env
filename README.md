## Pull the Skiff AMADEE image from a docker registry

1. Stop the skiff core service

```sh
systemctl stop skiff-core
```

2. Delete the previously build image

```sh
docker rmi core
```
3. Login for dockerhub (it could be that this command needs to be run 3-6 times till the command is successfull)

```sh
docker login --username christianbrommer --password <password>
```
4. Pull the image

```sh
docker pull christianbrommer/amadee:latest
```
5. Rename the image

```sh
docker tag amadee core
```

6. Restart the skiff-core service

```sh
systemctl start skiff-core
```

## Raspberry setup

USB power setting: By default the max current that can be drawn by the USB ports is 600mA. If the current drawn from the ports reaches over this limit, the USB is shutdown. By adding the following setting to /boot/config.txt the current for the USB ports can be increased to 1.2A
```
max_usb_current=1
```

## USB Media auto mount
Drives with the lable "amadee_drive" are automatically mounted to /amadee_data. Data is also accessable trough the symlinc "~/rec_media" in the home directory.
